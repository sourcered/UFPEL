                If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app. KICKGROW is a
                <br />framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript,
                <br />HTML, and CSS. It takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of
                <br />your application.

            <h1><span class="sunderline">What</span> is Node?</h1>
            <p>
                Node is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event
                <br />Machine or Python's Twisted. Node takes the event model a bit further.
                <br />It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library.
                <br />In other systems there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.
                <br />Typically behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script
                <br />and at the end starts a server through a blocking call like EventMachine::run().
                <br />In Node there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node simply enters the event
                <br />loop after executing the input script. Node exits the event loop when there are
                <br /> no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the
                <br /> event loop is hidden from the user.
                <br /> HTTP is a first class citizen in Node, designed with streaming and low latency
                <br /> in mind. This makes Node well suited for the foundation of a web library or framework.
                <br /> Just because Node is designed without threads, doesn't mean you cannot take advantage
                <br /> of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our
                <br /> child_process.fork() API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon
                <br /> that same interface is the cluster module, which allows you to share sockets between
                <br /> processes to enable load balancing over your cores.
